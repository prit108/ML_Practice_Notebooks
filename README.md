This is a repository of my jupyter notebooks I wrote while learning ML Algortihms.

1. Linear Regression - A comparative study of iterative gradient descent and normal equations method.
I tried linear regression to fit a linear model to Advertisement Dataset to predict sales given the advertising done in different media.
While using iterative approach, my learning rate initially set at 0.01 was too high for the data values. So had to fiddle with tuning the value before reaching an acceptable model.
Normal equations were simply elegant and with the help of numpy library the implementation was simple.
Scikit's linear regression returned the smae parameters as the normal equations, which is the optimal parametric values.

2. Logistic Regression -
